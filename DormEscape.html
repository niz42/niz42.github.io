        DormEscape is my MSc dissertation project which links to <a class="link" href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal12">Sustainable Development Goal 12</a>. This project aims to design a two-player escape room game to educate and encourage recycling in student dormitories. It included three phases: user study, game prototype and evaluation.

    <h1 class="subtitle">Context</h1>
    <p class="content">
        The importance of recycling is well recognized, yet governments worldwide continue to seek effective strategies to encourage active recycling practices among public. Games and gamification tools have emerged as valuable methods in this context. Despite the abundance of serious games focused on recycling education, there are notably few that incorporate dormitory settings or utilize the escape room format. Preliminary research indicates this as a promising area for development. Consequently, this project introduces a collaborative game designed in the escape room format, aimed at promoting and educating students about recycling within dormitory environments.
    </p>
    <p class="content">
        The development process began with a user study, combining cultural probes and interviews to gather user requirements and obtain design inspiration. The game prototype was then developed using Unity as the development engine. The game was evaluated by the target audience in pairs to assess its effectiveness.
    </p>
    <p class="content">
        Evaluation results indicate that the game is both educational and enjoyable, particularly highlighting the cooperative gameplay mechanism. This suggests that the game has the potential to be an effective tool for recycling education.

                This activity includes the instruction and three Instagram frameworks with different hashtags: "#DormCorner", "#GreenHabits", and a customizable hashtag. Participants were asked to take photos related to the hashtags using the Instagram frames. For example, the photos could show recycling efforts in their dormitory corners under "#DormCorner", reuse tips for "#GreenHabits". It encourages participants to direct their attention to corners of the dormitory that they would not normally notice, allowing them to perceive the space in different ways. Additionally, it enables me to observe a glimpse of their lives, providing valuable insights into their daily routines and environmental interactions.

                This task involves three subtasks based on a dormitory floor plan sample: drawing the layout of the dorm, marking the locations of bins, and using stickers to indicate places that make the participants feel happy, unhappy, or uncertain. The aim is to draw inspiration for environmental design within the game, such as furniture, items, and trash bins in the rooms, as the game is specifically designed to be set in a dormitory context.

                I used newspapers to make the package bags, aligning with the recycling theme of the project. This serves as a practical demonstration of the researcher's commitment to reuse, potentially allowing participants to learn more about my approach and values which could lead to more genuine and insightful responses. Additionally, the relatively rough, handmade appearance of the bags conveys an informal feel, encouraging participants to complete the task freely and creatively.

    <h2 class="subsubtitle">Semi-structured Interview</h2>

    <p class="content">
        From our visualizations of Assignment 2 and the given website we found some interesting data:
    </p>
    <img src="images/p3/data.png" style="width: 100%;">
    <p class="content">
        Our research shows a strong link between witch hunts and patriarchal systems. The accused witches were typically vulnerable women, involved in female-led activities or roles. They were often portrayed as consorting with male devils, reflecting a tendency to see women as subordinate to men. This demonstrates modern attitudes where powerful women, like female politicians, are derogatorily labelled as witches.
    </p>
    <h1 class="subtitle">Evaluation</h1>
    <p class="content">
        The primary audience for this project is young people, particularly those Digital Natives. They are significantly influenced by movies, video games and fantasy literature. Their perception of witches might be shaped by modern artistic creations. This age group is at a critical stage of forming their understanding of societal norms and history. It helps to overturn stereotypes and perceptions about gender and witches formed at an early age.
